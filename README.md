Integrated tool for learning Finnish with Prolog. It's a WordNet database and a SuperMemo-2 implementation in one file. All data entry is done manually by inserting more lines into the file.

Spaced repetition work flow:
- Run a SWI-Prolog shell
- `[main].`
- `next(Entry).` and press `;` for more entries to study
- Manually rate the score and add memo entries to the file
